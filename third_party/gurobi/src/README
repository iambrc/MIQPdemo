The files in this directory allow you to build the Gurobi C++
interface (gurobi_c++mt.lib) from source.  These files should only
be used by advanced users.  We provide no technical support for the
included source code, nor do we provide assistance in building or
using the resulting library.

To build gurobi_c++mt.lib, start a Developer Command Prompt for Visual
Studio, change to the 'build' directory, and type 'nmake'.

To use the result, modify your project file to link with
'gurobi_c++mt.lib' (which you'll find in the 'build' directory).
